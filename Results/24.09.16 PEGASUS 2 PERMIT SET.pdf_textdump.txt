REINFORCING STEEL IS NOT TO BE SPLICED WITHOUT THE WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. 17. SUBMIT SHOP DRAWINGS SHOWING ALL WORK RELATED TO TILT PANELS, INCLUDING TEMPORARY BRACING AND ERECTION PROCEDURES. REINFORCING BARS SHOWN ON THE CONTRACT DRAWINGS DO NOT ALLOW FOR LIFTING AND ERECTION STRESSES. WITH THE SHOP DRAWINGS SUBMIT DESCRIPTION COVERING ERECTION PROCEDURES, ADDITIONAL REINFORCEMENT, LIFTING HARDWARE, AND BRACING. TILT PANEL PLAN NOTES: 18. PANELS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR IN PLACE STRESSES ONLY. THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TEMPORARY BRACING, LIFTING HARDWARE, ADDITIONAL REINFORCING REQUIRED FOR LIFTING AND ERECTION PROCEDURES. REINFORCING BARS SHOWN ON CONTRACT DOCUMENTS DO NOT ALLOW FOR LIFTING AND ERECTION STRESSES. 19. PROVIDE CONTINUOUS NON-SHRINK GROUT UNDER ALL PANELS. CONTRACTOR TO GROUT UNDER ALL PANELS IMMEDIATELY AFTER PANELS ARE SET. 20. SHIM SHALL BE PLACED AT 5 FEET MAXIMUM (OR CLOSER) UNDER THE PANELS TO AVOID A CONTINUOUS FOOTING FROM BOWING UP DUE TO INVERSE SOIL PRESSURE. 21. KO INDICATES KNOCK OUT PANEL. 22. #3 LATERAL TIES SHALL BE BENT FROM STRAIGHT BARS (COIL RODS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED) TO PREVENT BOWING OF TIES AND DECREASING CLEAR COVER. 23. SUBMIT SHOP DRAWINGS SHOWING ALL PANEL EMBED PLATES AND LOCATIONS. GENERAL CONTRACTOR SHALL COORDINATE. 24. SEE ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS AND DETAILS FOR PANEL JOINT AND REVEAL JOINT DETAILS NOT SHOWN ON STRUCTURAL DRAWINGS. 25. PANELS ARE TO BE CAST OUTSIDE FACE DOWN. CASTING SLAB SHALL BE CURED. SAW CUTS, CRACKS AND JOINTS IN THE CASTING SLAB SHALL BE FILLED AND LEVELED WITH A SEALANT SO AS TO MINIMIZE TRANSFER OF THE JOINT LINE TO THE PANEL FACE. 26. TILT PANEL CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPATIBILITY OF CURING AGENTS, SEALANTS AND RELEASING AGENTS UTILIZED IN THE WORK. IF PANELS ARE TO BE STACKED, THE TROWELED SURFACE SHALL BE CONSIDERED THE CASTING SLAB AND TREATED AS SUCH BONDBREAKER SHALL BE APPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS REQUIREMENTS. 27. SEE PLAN FOR TILT PANEL THICKNESS. 28. CRACKS IN PANELS DUE TO LIFTING OR SHRINKAGE ARE TO BE REPAIRED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. PANELS THAT HAVE YIELDED AND CRACKED DURING LIFTING ARE TO BE REPLACED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. 29. GENERAL CONTRACTOR IS NOT TO DAMAGE FLOOR SLAB DURING PANEL ERECTION DUE TO CRANE LOADING. CONTRACTOR TO SUPPLY DESIGN ENGINEER WITH MAXIMUM CRANE LOADING ON SLAB FOR FLOOR STRENGTH EVALUATION PRIOR TO PANEL ERECTION. ANY DAMAGE TO THE FLOOR SLAB INCLUDING STRESS CRACKS RESULTING FROM LOADS EXCEEDING THOSE PROVIDED TO THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER ARE TO BE REPAIRED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. REPLACEMENT OF SLAB WILL BE REQUIRED IN AREAS SEVERELY DAMAGED DURING LIFTING. 30. ALL TEMPORARY BRACING SHALL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL ROOF DECK IS FULLY INSTALLED AND INSPECTED, AND CONCRETE POUR BACK STRIP IS FULLY INSTALLED AND HAS REACHED A MINIMUM STRENGTH OF 3000 PSI.

TILT PANELS ARE DRAWN IN ELEVATION FROM THE INSIDE OF THE BUILDING. 2. TILT PANELS SHOULD REMAIN BRACED UNTIL THE ENTIRETY OF THE ROOF DECK AND ROOF FRAMING HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE PANELS, AND THE CONCRETE SLAB POUR STRIP CONCRETE HAS BEEN PLACED. IN LIEU OF POUR STRIP CONCRETE MECHANICAL CONNECTIONS CAN BE MADE FROM THE BASE OF THE TILT PANEL TO THE FOOTING. 18. PANELS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR IN PLACE STRESSES ONLY. THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TEMPORARY BRACING, LIFTING HARDWARE, ADDITIONAL REINFORCING REQUIRED FOR LIFTING AND ERECTION PROCEDURES. REINFORCING BARS SHOWN ON CONTRACT DOCUMENTS DO NOT ALLOW FOR LIFTING AND ERECTION STRESSES. 19. PROVIDE CONTINUOUS NON-SHRINK GROUT UNDER ALL PANELS. CONTRACTOR TO GROUT UNDER 3.

SEE DETAILS ON S-520 FOR DETAILS AT GIRDER BEARING. 9. TILT PANEL SHALL BE NORMAL WEIGHT WITH f'c = 4000 PSI MINIMUM AT 28 DAYS, UNLESS NOTED OTHERWISE. 10. REINFORCEMENT SHALL BE CONTINUOUS THROUGH KNOCKOUT AREA (FUTURE OPENING). 11. TRIM VERTICAL BARS BACK AT STEPPED EDGES, TYPICAL TOP OF TILT PANEL. 12. SEE PANEL ELEVATIONS FOR LOCATIONS OF PANEL EMBED PLATES. 13. ALL TILT PANELS ARE ASSUMED TO BE PAINTED AND/OR WATERPROOFED, SEE ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS. UNPAINTED/UNPROTECTED PANELS SHALL HAVE 3% AIR ENTRAINMENT. CONCRETE SHALL BE A MINIMUM OF 3000 PSI AT THE TIME OF ERECTION. (CONCRETE SLUMP SHALL NOT EXCEED 4 INCHES). 14. FLY ASH AND/OR SLAG SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED IN TILT PANELS. 15. TILT PANELS CONSTRUCTION IS TO CONFORM TO ACI 117-90. (STANDARD TOLERANCES FOR CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS). 16. REINFORCING STEEL SHALL CONFORM TO ASTM A615 GRADE 60. REINFORCING STEEL DETAILING, FABRICATION AND PLACEMENT SHALL CONFORM TO THE LATEST EDITION OF CRSI'S (MANUAL OF STANDARD PRACTICE). REINFORCING STEEL IS NOT TO BE SPLICED WITHOUT THE WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. 17. SUBMIT SHOP DRAWINGS SHOWING ALL WORK RELATED TO TILT PANELS, INCLUDING TEMPORARY BRACING AND ERECTION PROCEDURES. REINFORCING BARS SHOWN ON THE CONTRACT DRAWINGS DO NOT ALLOW FOR LIFTING AND ERECTION STRESSES. WITH THE SHOP DRAWINGS SUBMIT DESCRIPTION COVERING ERECTION PROCEDURES, ADDITIONAL REINFORCEMENT, LIFTING HARDWARE, AND BRACING. 20. SHIM SHALL BE PLACED AT 5 FEET MAXIMUM (OR CLOSER) UNDER THE PANELS TO AVOID A CONTINUOUS FOOTING FROM BOWING UP DUE TO INVERSE SOIL PRESSURE. 21. KO INDICATES KNOCK OUT PANEL. 22. #3 LATERAL TIES SHALL BE BENT FROM STRAIGHT BARS (COIL RODS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED) TO PREVENT BOWING OF TIES AND DECREASING CLEAR COVER. 23.

SEE ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS AND DETAILS FOR PANEL JOINT AND REVEAL JOINT DETAILS NOT SHOWN ON STRUCTURAL DRAWINGS. 25. PANELS ARE TO BE CAST OUTSIDE FACE DOWN. CASTING SLAB SHALL BE CURED. SAW CUTS, CRACKS AND JOINTS IN THE CASTING SLAB SHALL BE FILLED AND LEVELED WITH A SEALANT SO AS TO MINIMIZE TRANSFER OF THE JOINT LINE TO THE PANEL FACE. 26. TILT PANEL CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPATIBILITY OF CURING AGENTS, SEALANTS AND RELEASING AGENTS UTILIZED IN THE WORK. IF PANELS ARE TO BE STACKED, THE TROWELED SURFACE SHALL BE CONSIDERED THE CASTING SLAB AND TREATED AS SUCH BONDBREAKER SHALL BE APPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS REQUIREMENTS. 27. SEE PLAN FOR TILT PANEL THICKNESS. 28. CRACKS IN PANELS DUE TO LIFTING OR SHRINKAGE ARE TO BE REPAIRED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. PANELS THAT HAVE YIELDED AND CRACKED DURING LIFTING ARE TO BE REPLACED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. 29. GENERAL CONTRACTOR IS NOT TO DAMAGE FLOOR SLAB DURING PANEL ERECTION DUE TO CRANE LOADING. CONTRACTOR TO SUPPLY DESIGN ENGINEER WITH MAXIMUM CRANE LOADING ON SLAB FOR FLOOR STRENGTH EVALUATION PRIOR TO PANEL ERECTION. ANY DAMAGE TO THE FLOOR SLAB INCLUDING STRESS CRACKS RESULTING FROM LOADS EXCEEDING THOSE PROVIDED TO THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER ARE TO BE REPAIRED BY THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR. REPLACEMENT OF SLAB WILL BE REQUIRED IN AREAS SEVERELY DAMAGED DURING LIFTING. 30. ALL TEMPORARY BRACING SHALL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL ROOF DECK IS FULLY INSTALLED AND INSPECTED, AND CONCRETE POUR BACK STRIP IS FULLY INSTALLED AND HAS REACHED A MINIMUM STRENGTH OF 3000 PSI.
